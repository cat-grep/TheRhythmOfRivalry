# The Rhythm of Rivalry  
### A Visual Story of College Fight Songs

This project is an interactive data-driven story exploring the **musical, lyrical and geographic patterns of U.S. college fight songs**. Using coordinated visualizations, it examines how tempo, song length, lyrics, authorship, conferences and history shape one of the most recognizable traditions in American college sports culture.

The application was inspired by the **BTAA Data Visualization Student Championship** and builds upon the original fight song analysis by **FiveThirtyEight**, extending it with richer interaction, geographic context and musical interpretation.
