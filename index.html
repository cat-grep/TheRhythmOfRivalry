                <p class="desc">Conferences group schools that often share similar traditions and competitive
                    environments.
                    Using color by conference makes it easier to spot patterns across regions and rivalries.
                    As you scroll, notice how some musical traits repeat within the same conference.</p>

                <h2>Where College Fight Songs Took Root</h2>
                <p class="desc">Fight songs are distributed across the entire United States, reflecting the nationwide
                    reach of college athletics.
                    However, clear clusters appear in the <strong>Midwest and Southeast,</strong> regions with
                    long-standing college football traditions and dense concentrations of major programs.
                    Clicking on a stadium links geography to sound.</p>

            <div id="section-bpm" class="section">
                <h2>Tempo (Beats Per Minute)</h2>
                <p class="desc">Most fight songs cluster in two tempo ranges: roughly <strong>70–85 BPM and 130–165
                        BPM.</strong>
                    Tempo alone, however, does not determine how energetic a song feels, arrangement, rhythm and
                    instrumentation also play an important role.
                    For example, <i>Mighty Oregon (University of Oregon)</i> and <i>Ride ’Em Cowboys (Oklahoma State
                        University)</i>
                    sit at very different tempos, yet both sound energetic and are well suited for marching and crowd
                    participation.</p>

            <div id="section-duration" class="section">
                <h2>Song Length (Seconds)</h2>
                <p class="desc">Fight songs are usually short so they can be easily repeated during games.
                    Most songs last between <strong>40 and 100 seconds,</strong> while longer songs often include
                    repeated sections or verses.
                    For example, <i>Aggie War Hymn (Texas A&M University)</i> repeats the same melody multiple times,
                    illustrating how fight songs
                    prioritize being catchy, repeatable and functional in a stadium setting.</p>

                <h2>Energy vs. Stamina</h2>
                <p class="desc">
                    This chart compares <strong>tempo (BPM)</strong> with <strong>song length (seconds)</strong> to
                    examine how energy relates to duration in fight songs.
                    While tempo clearly clusters into a few common ranges, song length appears much more variable, with
                    no strong pattern tied to tempo.
                    This suggests that tempo follows shared musical conventions, whereas duration is shaped more by
                    tradition, structure or ceremonial use than by speed.

            <h2>When Fight Songs Were Written</h2>
            <p class="desc">There is a clear <strong>“golden age”</strong> of fight song composition between
                <strong>1905 and 1925</strong>, which aligns with the rapid rise of college football in the United
                States.
                Few new fight songs have been written since then, suggesting traditions tend to persist once
                established.
                The oldest song in the dataset, <i>The Good Old Song (University of Virginia),</i> dates back to 1893.

        <div id="section-student" class="section">
            <h2>Written by Students?</h2>
            <p class="desc">Nearly <strong>half</strong> of all fight songs (about 49%) were written by students,
                highlighting their direct role in shaping school traditions and spirit.
                Rather than being purely institutional creations, many fight songs originated from within the student
                body itself.
                This helps explain why these songs often feel personal, enduring and closely tied to campus identity.
                The variety of schools represented shows that student-driven traditions span conferences and regions,
                not just a single type of institution.</p>

            <h2>Common Lyrics and Chants</h2>
            <p class="desc">Unsurprisingly, the word <strong>“fight”</strong> appears most frequently across lyrics,
                followed by common terms such as “win,” “victory” and references to school colors.
                These simple and repetitive phrases make fight songs easy to remember and chant together in a crowd.
                Although <strong>nonsense</strong> syllables or chants appear less often overall, they may function less
                as filler and more as a marker of belonging, helping songs feel distinctive and meaningful to school
                communities.</p>

            <h2>Top 10 “Fightiest” Schools</h2>
            <p class="desc">
                Some schools lean heavily into the word <strong>“fight”</strong> as a core part of their musical
                identity.
                <i>Texas Fight (University of Texas)</i> stands out by a wide margin, with significantly more “fight”
                mentions than any other school, while the rest of the top ten cluster much closer together.
                This suggests that while nearly all fight songs emphasize competition, a few schools amplify that
                message far more aggressively than others.

            <h2>Lyric Co-occurrence</h2>
            <p class="desc">
                This matrix shows how often different lyric tropes appear together within the same fight song.
                Competitive terms such as <strong>“fight,” “win,” and “victory”</strong> frequently co-occur, indicating
                that these words tend to reinforce one another rather than appear in isolation.
                In contrast, elements like <strong>“nonsense” and “rah”</strong> show weaker co-occurrence with other
                tropes, suggesting they are used more selectively to add character rather than to carry the main
                competitive message.
